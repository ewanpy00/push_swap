This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by ipykhtin (this text should be italicized)
                    
Description:

the Objective of the project is to write a sorting algoritm to sort a stack of integers using only 2 stacks. And the Objective of the bonus part is to write a checker file for the algorithm.

Instructions:
    push_swap can be compiled with "make" command
    to run the code ./push_swap "integers separated with space or tab" without italices

    to compile the checker file use "make checker"
    and to test the algorithm with checker run ./checker "integers separated with space or tab" without italices

    To count the number of operations previous command can be modified with | wc -l
