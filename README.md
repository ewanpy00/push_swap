# push_swap

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by ipykhtin.*

---

## Description

The objective of the **push_swap** project is to write an efficient sorting algorithm that sorts a stack of integers using only **two stacks** and a limited set of operations.

The **bonus part** of the project consists of implementing a **checker** program that verifies whether the sorting algorithm works correctly.

## Instructions

### Compile push_swap
```bash
make
```

### Compile checker (bonus)
```bash
make checker
```

---

## Usage

### Run push_swap
```bash
./push_swap "integers separated by spaces or tabs"
```

Example:
```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1"
```

### Run checker
```bash
./checker "integers separated by spaces or tabs"
```

Example:
```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1" | ./checker "3 2 1"
```

---

## Count the Number of Operations

To count how many operations are generated by `push_swap`, use:

```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1" | wc -l
```
