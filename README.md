# push_swap

*This project has been created as part
of the 42 curriculum by ipykhtin.*

---

## Description

**push_swap** is a constrained sorting problem: sort a list of integers using **two stacks** (`a` and `b`) and a **restricted set of operations**, while producing the **smallest possible number of moves**.

The project is split into two parts:

* **Mandatory**: the `push_swap` program, which outputs a sequence of operations that sorts the stack.
* **Bonus**: the `checker` program, which validates whether a given sequence of operations correctly sorts the stack.

---

## Constraints & Rules

* Only **two stacks** are allowed: `a` and `b`
* Only the following operations can be used:

| Operation     | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sa` / `sb`   | Swap the first two elements of stack `a` / `b`         |
| `ss`          | `sa` and `sb` at the same time                         |
| `pa` / `pb`   | Push the top element from one stack to the other       |
| `ra` / `rb`   | Rotate stack up (first element becomes last)           |
| `rr`          | `ra` and `rb` at the same time                         |
| `rra` / `rrb` | Reverse rotate stack down (last element becomes first) |
| `rrr`         | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time                       |

## Features

* Handles **negative numbers** and **integer limits**
* Detects **invalid input** (non-numeric values, duplicates)
* Optimized strategies for:

  * Small inputs (≤ 5 numbers)
  * Large inputs (100 / 500 numbers)
* Efficient move count using a **Turk algorithm–based approach**

## Instructions

### Compile `push_swap`

```bash
make
```

### Compile `checker` (bonus)

```bash
make bonus
```

---

## Usage

### Run `push_swap`

```bash
./push_swap "integers separated by spaces or tabs"
```

Example:

```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1"
```

### Run `checker`

```bash
./checker "integers separated by spaces or tabs"
```

Example:

```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1" | ./checker "3 2 1"
```

If the sequence is correct, `checker` prints:

```
OK
```

Otherwise:

```
KO
```

---

## Counting Operations

To count the number of operations generated by `push_swap`:

```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1" | wc -l
```

This metric is critical for grading, as fewer operations yield a better score.

## Algorithm Overview

### Strategy by Input Size

* **2–3 numbers**: Direct swaps and rotations
* **4–5 numbers**: Push smallest elements to stack `b`, sort the rest, then push back
* **> 5 numbers**: Chunk-based strategy using the **Turk algorithm**

---

## The Turk Algorithm (Detailed Explanation)

The **Turk algorithm** is a popular and efficient strategy for solving the `push_swap` problem with large input sizes. Its strength lies in **minimizing total operations** by calculating the *cheapest possible move* at every step.

### Core Idea

Instead of blindly pushing values between stacks, the Turk algorithm:

1. pushes the elements to stack `b` based on the chnuks
2. Calculates the **cost (number of moves)** for each possible push from stack `b` to stack `a`
3. Always executes the **cheapest move available**
